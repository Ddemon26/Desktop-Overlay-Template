## Project Overview

The **Desktop Overlay Template** is a sophisticated, Unity-based framework that facilitates the creation of customizable desktop overlay systems. This system is primarily designed for advanced desktop applications, providing developers with the capability to generate transparent overlays, integrate complex visual effects, and manage dynamic particle systems. These features are suitable for a broad range of applications, including gaming, productivity enhancement, and specialized visual augmentation for desktop environments.

This project comprises a comprehensive suite of reusable scripts, configuration assets, and exemplar scenes intended to streamline the implementation of overlay systems. Leveraging Unity's UI Toolkit, the project supports advanced transparent window functionality, allowing for both interactive overlays and passive, non-obtrusive visual layers.

## Features

- **Overlay System**: Facilitates the creation of transparent, click-through overlays applicable to desktop environments, offering seamless integration into user workflows.
- **Particle Controller**: Provides an extensible particle management architecture for incorporating dynamic and responsive visual effects within overlays.
- **Effect Wizard**: Includes a suite of tools for configuring, managing, and applying visual effects to overlay components, enabling precise control over effect behaviors.
- **UI Toolkit Integration**: Offers robust integration with Unity's UI Toolkit, allowing for intricate design and modification of UI components.
- **Sample Scene**: A sample Unity scene (`OverlaySampleScene.unity`) is included to illustrate core functionalities and serve as a foundational reference for developers.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP file.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ddemon26/Desktop-Overlay-Template.git
   ```
2. **Open the Project**: Open the project in Unity (recommended version: Unity 2020.3 or newer).
3. **Install Required Packages**: Verify that all necessary Unity packages are installed. You may need to manually import the Unity UI Toolkit if it is not included by default.

## Usage

- **Overlay Setup**: Utilize the provided `OverlaySampleScene.unity` as an initial reference for understanding the process of setting up transparent overlays. This scene serves as a comprehensive example demonstrating the integration of core overlay functionalities.
- **Creating Effects**: The `OverlayWizard` directory includes scripts for effect management and customization. Developers can leverage `EffectWizard.cs` and `EffectHandler.cs` to introduce new visual effects into their overlays, offering a high degree of customization.
- **UI Customization**: Modify and extend user interface elements using the `UIToolKit` scripts, which include `.uxml` and `.uss` files. These components are designed to facilitate the creation of sophisticated, user-friendly interfaces.

For detailed customization, refer to the inline documentation within the individual scripts, as well as the Unity official documentation regarding transparent windows and overlay development.

## Project Structure

- **OverlayWizard**: Contains scripts and configuration assets designed to manage visual effects and wizards, providing a streamlined approach to complex effect management.
- **ParticleController**: Responsible for managing particle system parameters and offers a comprehensive set of tools for the visual customization of overlay elements.
- **UIToolKit**: Comprises UI design assets, including `MainView.cs`, `.uxml`, and `.uss` files, that form the foundation for creating advanced user interface elements.
- **Window**: Includes scripts for configuring transparent window behavior, click-through capabilities, and related functionalities essential for desktop overlays.
